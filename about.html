      <h2>About PARKHOUND</h2>
      <p>
        Almost half of all Australian households include at least one dog, and
        it's common knowledge that dogs do great things for the wellbeing of
        their owners. A study of dog owners in Perth showed that dogs actually
        benefit the whole community by increasing opportunities for people to
        socialise, make new friends and form long term relationships that have
        positive flow on effects for the whole community.
      </p>

      <p>
        PARKHOUND was created to help Western Australians discover new off-lead
        places to explore with their dog, while hopefully making new friends
        along the way.
      </p>

      <h2>About the app</h2>
      <p>
        PARKHOUND aims to respond to a significant gap in the online information
        available to Western Australian dog owners. There is currently no
        comprehensive, searchable resource to find dog exercise areas. A dog
        owner looking for a place to take their pet will find information is
        presently fragmented across various blogs, incomplete Google Maps search
        results, and information in a variety of formats on individual local
        government websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Current Coverage</h3>
      <p><strong>7 Perth Local Government Areas:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>City of Bayswater</li>
        <li>City of Canning</li>
        <li>City of Cockburn</li>
        <li>Town of East Fremantle</li>
        <li>City of Fremantle</li>
        <li>City of Melville</li>
        <li>City of South Perth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Building the map</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most of PARKHOUND's data is accessed via official local government
          website API endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Town of East Fremantle's dog parks were added manually and checked
          against council information.
        </li>
        <li>
          The local government data was then combined with OpenStreetMap to show
          the park boundaries.
        </li>
        <li>Contact details were sourced from WALGA's 2024 directory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is that PARKHOUND covers all of Western Australia. We will
        reach out to the remaining 130 local governments to request access to
        their geospatial data for dog exercise areas, ensuring consistency and
        faster updates.
